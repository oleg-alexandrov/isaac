Overview</h2>
<p>This document describes how to process and fuse depth and image data coming from an Astrobee robot. The two main tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The geometry mapper: This tool handles offline processing of robot data to create a dense 3D model of robot's environment and a texture overlaid on top of it.</li>
<li>The streaming mapper: This is a ROS node that takes as input a previously computed 3D model using the geometry mapper, a current image and pose as the robot flies around the environment, and computes and publishes an updated texture.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>The following environmental variables should be set up (please adjust them for your particular configuration): </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_WS=$HOME/astrobee
export ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH=$ASTROBEE_WS/src
export ISAAC_WS=$HOME/isaac
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md59"></a>
Robot sensors</h2>
<p>This software makes use of three sensors that are mounted on the front face of the robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>haz cam: A low-resolution depth and intensity camera</li>
<li>nav cam: A wide field of view medium-resolution navigation camera</li>
<li>sci cam: A high-resolution narrow field of view "science" camera</li>
</ul>
<p>The nav cam is used to determine robot's position and orientation as it explores its environment.</p>
<p>Based on this, and the transform between the nav and haz cameras, the haz cam depth readings are fused into a dense 3D model of the environment.</p>
<p>The sci cam is then used to texture this model. Alternatively, the nav cam pictures can be used for the texture as well.</p>
<p>An important note here is that the haz cam takes measurements about five times per second, the nav cam perhaps twice per second, while the science camera is triggered by an explicit command to take a picture, unless set in continuous picture-taking mode. This aspect of the sci cam will be elaborated later on.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Actual vs simulated robot data</h2>
<p>To be able to obtain high-fidelity results based on fusing the readings of these sensors, as described earlier, a lot of careful work needs to be done, that we discuss later in much detail. In particular, the intrinsics of all the cameras must be calibrated accurately, the transforms between their poses must be found, a sparse map based on the nav cam data must be computed and registered, and various conversions and interpolations (in time) between these sensors must be computed.</p>
<p>These problems are greatly simplified with simulated data, when we assume perfectly known cameras, including their intrinsics, how they relate to each other, and their poses in space at any time. Hence, working with simulated data makes it easy to test core aspects of this sensor fusion functionality in a simplified setting.</p>
<p>The drawback is that having two such sources of input data complicates the presentation of these tools. Some of them will be relevant only for one of the two data types, and some tools that apply to both may have different invocations for each case. The reader is advised to keep close attention to this, and we will make it clear at every step about which of the two paradigms one refers to.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
Sensors present in simulation</h2>
<p>The simulator supports the <code>nav_cam</code>, <code>sci_cam</code>, <code>haz_cam</code> cameras, which are analogous to the ones on the real robot, and also the <code>heat_cam</code> and <code>acoustics_cam</code> cameras which exist only in simulation. All these have been tested with the geometry mapper and streaming mapper.</p>
<p>The <code>sci_cam</code> and <code>haz_cam</code> cameras are not enabled by default in the simulator. To enable them, edit the simulation configuration, in </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/simulation/simulation.config
</pre><p>and set: </p><pre class="fragment">haz_cam_rate = 1.0;
sci_cam_rate = 1.0;
sci_cam_continuous_picture_taking = true;
</pre><p>The later will make sure sci cam pictures are taken automatically. If custom behavior is desired, see: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/src/astrobee/behaviors/inspection/readme.md
</pre><p>More information about the simulated nav_cam, haz_cam, and sci_cam is at: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/simulation/readme.md
</pre><p>The heat camera is described in: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/src/astrobee/simulation/isaac_gazebo/readme.md
</pre><p>The acoustics camera and how to enable it is documented at: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/src/astrobee/simulation/acoustics_cam/readme.md
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
Adding support for new cameras</h2>
<p>For an actual camera, rather than a simulated one, the files: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/cameras.config
$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/geometry.config
$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/transforms.config
$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/robots/robotName.config
</pre><p>should be modified and entities added, mirroring <code>sci_cam</code>, so having fields for intrinsics, extrinsics (nav cam to given cam transform), timestamp offset (by default it should be 0), and body to given camera transform.</p>
<p>Note the first three config files above are used by any robot, while the last one refers only to the robot that is desired to use with the new camera. The Lua-based processing of config files is tolerant of the fact that a different robot config file lacks a new camera's settings even if the shared config files define them. For a camera that is expected to be present on all robots, each robot config file should be changed, but otherwise just a desired robot's file can be modified, in addition to the shared files.</p>
<p>For a simulated camera, the above is not necessary. Instead, that camera must define the topics: </p><pre class="fragment">/sim/some_cam/pose
/sim/some_cam/info
</pre><p>where the desired camera was named <code>some_cam</code>, having the camera poses and camera intrinsics info, respectively. It is suggested to follow the example of <code>heat_cam</code> or <code>sci_cam</code> when creating such a simulated camera.</p>
<p>Then, whether the camera is real or simulated, a topic is expected on which its images will be published, for example, named: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_some
</pre><p>which then need to be passed to the geometry and streaming mappers, per the documentation for these tools.</p>
<p>To visualize images published by your camera in <code>rviz</code>, appropriate entities must be added in <code>iss.rviz</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Uncompressed or compressed images are supported, but for the latter adjustments must be made, mirroring <code>sci_cam</code>. For example, the image topic should be: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_some/compressed
</pre><p>except in <code>iss.rviz</code>, where the suffix <code>/compressed</code> is not needed, but instead the one sets <code>Transport Hint: compressed</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md63"></a>
Compiling the software</h2>
<p>It is assumed that by now the Astrobee and ISAAC software is compiled.</p>
<p>This module depends on two additional pieces of software, Voxblox and CGAL.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md64"></a>
Compiling VoxBlox</h3>
<p>To compile Voxblox, clone </p><pre class="fragment">https://github.com/oleg-alexandrov/voxblox/
</pre><p>(branch master). This fork differs from the main repository at <a href="https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox">https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox</a> by the introduction of a small tool named batch_tsdf.cc that reads the clouds to fuse and the transforms from disk and writes the output mesh back to disk, instead of using ROS. It also can take into account a point's reliability when fusing the clouds, which is computed by the geometry mapper.</p>
<p>Compile it using the instructions at: </p><pre class="fragment">https://github.com/oleg-alexandrov/voxblox/blob/master/docs/pages/Installation.rst
</pre><p>This should end up creating the program: </p><pre class="fragment">$HOME/catkin_ws/devel/lib/voxblox_ros/batch_tsdf
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md65"></a>
Compiling CGAL</h3>
<p>Compile the CGAL tools using the commands: </p><pre class="fragment">mkdir -p $HOME/projects
cd $HOME/projects
git clone https://github.com/oleg-alexandrov/cgal_tools
cd cgal_tools
git checkout d3467a9 
wget https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/v5.3/CGAL-5.3.tar.xz
tar xfv CGAL-5.3.tar.xz
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCGAL_DIR:PATH=CGAL-5.3
make -j 10
</pre><p>CGAL will fail to build with cmake version 3.10 installed with Ubuntu</p><ol type="1">
<li>It is suggested to fetch cmake version 3.15 or later.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outcome will be that some programs will be installed in: </p><pre class="fragment">$HOME/projects/cgal_tools
</pre><p>which will be later looked up by the geometry mapper.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md66"></a>
CGAL license</h3>
<p>CGAL is released under the GPL. Care must be taken to not include it or to link to it in any ISAAC code. Using CGAL as standalone tools does not infringe upon GPL.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md67"></a>
Functionality provided by CGAL</h3>
<p>The tools just compiled are used for smoothing meshes, filling holes, remeshing, removing small connected components, and simplifying the mesh. The geometry mapper can work even without these, but they produce nicer results. The geometry mapper uses all of them except the experimental remeshing tool.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md68"></a>
Data acquisition</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md69"></a>
With real data</h3>
<p>Acquire a bag of data on the bot. The current approach is to use a recording profile. A step-by-step procedure is outlined below if a recording profile has not been set up.</p>
<p>First give the bot the ability to acquire intensity data with the depth camera (haz_cam). For that, connect to the MLP processor of the bot. Edit the file: </p><pre class="fragment">/opt/astrobee/config/cameras.config
</pre><p>Go to the section: </p><pre class="fragment">picoflexx = {
  api_key = "",
</pre><p>and insert between the quotes the magic number which is not documented as it is not public. If that is not done, depth point clouds will still be produced, but without the intensity.</p>
<p>Every time the software on the robot is reinstalled this number get forgotten, so it needs to be put back.</p>
<p>Next, open several connections to the LLP processor of astrobee as: </p><pre class="fragment">ssh astrobee@llp_ip_address
</pre><p>In the first terminal on the bot, run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch astrobee astrobee.launch mlp:=mlp llp:=llp
</pre><p>In the second one, run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch /opt/astrobee/share/pico_driver/launch/pico_proxy.launch
</pre><p>In another terminal on LLP start the sci cam, as described in: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/submodules/android/gs_examples/sci_cam_image/readme.md
</pre><p>If you acquire data for calibration, or even for mapping, you may want to turn on continuous picture taking for the sci cam as described there.</p>
<p>Note: It is easier to use adb control the camera, per the instructions at the bottom of that document, than by using the guest science manager.</p>
<p>In another terminal on LLP, do </p><pre class="fragment">cd /data/bags
rosbag record /hw/cam_nav /hw/depth_haz/points                   \
  /hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int /hw/cam_sci/compressed
</pre><p>Scan a wall or a larger area with the bot facing the wall as much as possible, and carefully scan objects jutting out of the wall. Later one can also acquire images with various camera positions and orientations, which help build an accurate sparse map, but those should not be used when fusing the depth clouds or in texturing.</p>
<p>Copy the resulting bag off the robot.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md70"></a>
With simulated data</h3>
<p>The astrobee simulator supports a handful of cameras, mentioned earlier in the text.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md71"></a>
Recording simulated data</h4>
<p>Start the simulator, such as: </p><pre class="fragment">source $ASTROBEE_WS/devel/setup.bash
source $ISAAC_WS/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch isaac sim.launch rviz:=true      \
  pose:="11.0 -7.0 5.0 0 0 0 1" world:=iss
</pre><p>In rviz turn on visualizing the desired cameras cameras from the Panels menu, as otherwise the needed camera topics may not be published.</p>
<p>Adjust the 3D view in rviz with the mouse so that the robot, which is present in the middle of the module, can be seen.</p>
<p>When recording simulated data for a given camera, for example, for <code>sci_cam</code>, so that later it can be used with the geometry and streaming mapper, one needs to record, in addition to depth clouds and camera images, also the camera poses and intrinsics information, which is done as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">rosbag record /hw/depth_haz/points                           \
  /hw/cam_sci/compressed /sim/sci_cam/pose /sim/sci_cam/info
</pre><p>It is good to check for the precise name of the camera image topic. For haz cam the image topic will be instead: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int
</pre><p>For nav cam, the image topic will be: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_nav
</pre><p>and the same convention is followed for the rest of the cameras.</p>
<p>If desired to record data for many cameras, these topics must be specified for each of them. For example, for <code>heat_cam</code> add the lines: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_heat /sim/heat_cam/pose /sim/heat_cam/info
</pre><p>to the <code>rosbag record</code> command.</p>
<p>The robot can be told to move around by either running a plan, or by sending it a move command, such as: </p><pre class="fragment">rosrun mobility teleop -move -pos "11.0 -5.0 5.0" -tolerance_pos 0.0001 -att "0 0 0 1"
</pre><p>when it will go along the module axis while not changing its orientation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md72"></a>
Data pre-processing</h2>
<p>This applies only to real data.</p>
<p>If the recorded data is split into many small bags, as it often happens on the ISS, those bags should be first merged as documented in: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/localization/sparse_mapping/readme.md
</pre><p>In order to save bandwidth, the sci cam images are published at a reduced resolution (usually 640x480 pixels), while the full-resolution pictures are saved to disk in a directory on HLP. That directory needs to be fetched (see the sci cam documentation for details) and the pictures integrated into the bag with the command: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/devel/lib/geometry_mapper/add_sci_cam_to_bag \
    -input_bag &lt;input.bag&gt; -output_bag &lt;output.bag&gt;    \
    -sci_cam_dir &lt;sci_cam_dir&gt;                         \
    -sci_cam_topic /hw/cam_sci/compressed
</pre><p>Any images in the input bag on the sci cam topic (presumably previews) will be removed before the images from the sci cam directory are appended. Only the images from the directory whose timestamp is within the time range of what is in the bag already will be added.</p>
<p>EXIF metadata from the sci cam images (exposure, ISO sensitivity, aperture, and focal length) will be saved in the bag file as well.</p>
<p>(Normally the sci cam data will be downloaded from the HLP of ISS robots using some established infrastructure. Alternatively, one can use <code>adb pull</code>. After this tool is used, the data can be manually deleted from HLP by first connecting to it with <code>adb shell</code>.)</p>
<p>In order to run camera_calibrator, the sci cam data in the bag needs to be decompressed, resized to 1/4 of the resolution, and made to be grayscale. This is needed since the sci cam images are a little blurry and, at full resolution, the corners of the calibration target are hard to detect. The calibrator also does not handle the color format in the bag, hence the switch to grayscale images.</p>
<p>However, both the geometry and the streaming mapper, as well as camera_refiner, can handle both color and grayscale images, and both at reduced resolution and full-resolution. These tools can adjust for the fact that the calibration was done at reduced resolution.</p>
<p>To accomplish this processing, once the sci cam data is integrated into the bag, one can do the following: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/devel/lib/geometry_mapper/scale_bag --input_bag input.bag \
  --output_bag output.bag --image_type grayscale --scale 0.25
</pre><p>Note that the processed sci cam images will be now on topic <code>/hw/cam_sci2</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md73"></a>
Camera calibration</h2>
<p>Currently the calibrator solution is not that accurate. It is suggested to use instead camera_refiner (see further down) on a bag acquired without a calibration target.</p>
<p>Camera calibration is an advanced topic. Likely your robot's cameras have been calibrated by now, and then this step can be skipped.</p>
<p>This step applies only to real data and not to simulated data.</p>
<p>Data for calibration of the cameras should be acquired and processed as described earlier, to reduce the image resolution and to make them grayscale. The sci cam should be configured beforehand to take pictures continuously.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the robot cameras have been calibrated using Kalibr, using the instructions at </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/scripts/calibrate/readme.md
</pre><p>While Kalibr returns good results for calibrating the nav cam, it is unable to calibrate the depth portion of the haz cam, and cannot model the fact that there may be a systematic offset between the time stamps recorded by the various cameras (the reason for this offset is because the published time can differ slightly than the true time at which the image is taken).</p>
<p>It is recommended to use instead the calibrator provided with this software, which can take care of those issues. The procedure to use it is as follows.</p>
<p>First invoke Kalibr to save to disk the corners of the calibration target it detects from the bag. That can be done as follows. (This builds upon the instructions used in the doc referenced right above.) </p><pre class="fragment">source $KALIBR_WS/devel/setup.bash
rosrun kalibr kalibr_calibrate_cameras                                           \
  --topics /mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record                                 \
           /hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int                                  \
           /hw/cam_sci2                                                          \
  --models pinhole-fov pinhole-radtan pinhole-radtan                             \
  --target $ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/scripts/calibrate/config/granite_april_tag.yaml \
  --bag calibration.bag --dont-show-report --verbose                             \
  --target_corners_dirs calib_nav calib_haz calib_sci
</pre><p>Note that above we assume that the image sampler was used to collect a subset of the nav cam images. Otherwise the nav cam topic would be <code>/hw/cam_nav</code>.</p>
<p>This will create three directories with the corners extracted from the nav, haz, and sci cameras.</p>
<p>Next, set up the environment: </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/resources
export ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config
export ASTROBEE_WORLD=iss
export ASTROBEE_ROBOT=bsharp2
</pre><p>Note the name of the robot, in this case it is 'bsharp2'. When the calibrator is invoked, it will look for the configuration file named </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config/robots/bsharp2.config
</pre><p>and will modify it in-place. If you would like to calibrate a new robot, first create the corresponding config file by necessarily making a copy of an existing one.</p>
<p>The calibrator program is at: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/devel/lib/geometry_mapper/camera_calibrator
</pre><p>It can be used to calibrate the intrinsics of the nav and haz camera pair, and then of the sci and haz pair. These are referred to as <code>cam1</code> and <code>cam2</code> below.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the haz cam records both an image intensity and a depth point cloud.</p>
<p>Its options are: </p><pre class="fragment">--cam1_name: A string. The name of the first camera. Must be
    'nav_cam' or 'sci_cam'.

--cam2_name: A string. The name of the second camera. Must be
    'haz_cam'.

--cam1_dir: A string. The directory having the corners extracted
    from cam1 images using Kalibr.

--cam2_dir: A string. The directory having the corners extracted
    from cam2 images using Kalibr.

--bag: A string. The ros bag having the calibration data.

--haz_cam_points_topic. A string. The depth point cloud topic in
    the bag file. The default is /hw/depth_haz/points.

--start: A double. The starting time in seconds from which to
    process the bag. The default is 0.0 (beginning of the
    bag).

    default is 'false'.

--update_depth_to_image_transform: A boolean. Update the transform
    to apply to scale correctly the depth camera clouds. The
    default is 'false'.

--update_extrinsics: A boolean. Update the transform from cam2 to
    cam1. The default is 'false'.

--timestamp_offset_sampling: A string. If specified, as 'beg end
    num', create num samples between beg and end, and determine
    the timestamp offset between these cameras as the sample
    minimizing the extrinsics error among cam1 and cam2.

--cam1_intrinsics_to_float: A string. Refine 0 or more of the
    following intrinsics for cam1: focal_length, optical_center,
    distortion. Specify as a quoted list. For example: 
    'focal_length optical_center'.

--num_cam1_focal_lengths: An integer. If set to 2, use separate
    focal lengths along image rows and columns for cam1. Else use
    the same one. The default is 1.

--num_cam2_focal_lengths: An integer. If set to 2, use separate
    focal lengths along image rows and columns for cam2. Else use
    the same one. The default is 1.

--num_cam1_iterations: An integer. How many solver iterations to
    perform to solve for cam1 intrinsics. The default is 10000.

--num_cam2_iterations: An integer. How many solver iterations to
    perform to solve for cam2 intrinsics. The default is 10000.

--num_extrinsics_iterations: An integer. How many solver
    iterations to perform to solve for extrinsics. The default is
    10000.

--robust_threshold: A double. Pixel errors much larger than this
    will be exponentially attenuated to affect less the cost
    function. This should not be too low, as if the initial guess
    is off, initial pixel errors can be rather large. The default
    is 4.0.

--parameter_tolerance: A double. Stop when the optimization
    variables change by less than this. The default is 1e-12.

--calib_num_ransac_iterations: An integer. Use in this many RANSAC
    iterations to find camera poses based on calibration target
    measurements. The default is 1000.

--calib_ransac_inlier_tolerance: An integer. Use this inlier
    tolerance (in pixels) to find camera poses. The default is 10.

--max_interp_dist: A double. If two consecutive camera poses have
    timestamps that differ more than this, do not interpolate
    between them. The default is 4.0.

--max_haz_cam_image_to_depth_timestamp_diff: A double. Use depth
    haz cam clouds that are within this distance in time from the
    nearest haz cam intensity image. The default is 0.2.

--output_dir: A string. If provided, write here the residuals
    (differences between pixel target corners and projection into
    cameras of measured target points) before and after
    optimization.

</pre><p>The last two options better not be used at all, or with a lot of care.</p>
<p>This tool can return an incorrect solution for distortion unless a lot of care is taken to have many target points at the periphery of the sensor. If in doubt, that parameter better be kept fixed. The camera refiner can refine the sci cam intrinsics and will likely do a better job.</p>
<p>It was found experimentally that the depth to image transform which is updated by <code>--update_depth_to_image_transform</code> depends very much on how far the calibration target is from the camera. The value of <code>hazcam_depth_to_image_transform</code> already in the robot config file, which shows roughly a scale transform with a factor of 0.95 is good enough.</p>
<p>One has to be also be careful with the option <code>--timestamp_offset_sampling</code>, and even avoid using it in a first pass.</p>
<p>Notice that here we chose to not update the intrinsics of cam1 (nav_cam). That is because this camera was calibrated with Kalibr a while ago and it is known to be accurate. If desired to calibrate it, one can add the option <code>--update_cam1</code>`.</p>
<p>Only if after using the geometry mapper one notices visible registration errors (which manifest themselves as artifacts in the texture output by this tool), should one consider tweaking the parameters controlled by these options.</p>
<p>The next step is to calibrate the sci cam and haz cam pairs, which can go as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/devel/lib/geometry_mapper/camera_calibrator                   \
    --start 0 --duration 300 --cam1_name sci_cam --cam1_dir calib_sci   \
    --cam2_name haz_cam --cam2_dir calib_haz                            \
    --haz_cam_points_topic /hw/depth_haz/points --bag mybag.bag         \
    --update_cam1                                                       \
    --cam1_intrinsics_to_float 'focal_length optical_center'            \
    --num_cam1_iterations 10000 --num_cam1_focal_lengths 1              \
    --update_extrinsics                                                 \
    --timestamp_offset_sampling '-0.35 -0.15 11'
</pre><p>As before, one better not use the option <code>--timestamp_offset_sampling</code> unless one is sure it is necessary.</p>
<p>Note that this time we optimize the intrinsics of cam1 (sci_cam) and we do not use <code>--update_depth_to_image_transform</code> or optimize the intrinsics of cam2 (haz_cam) as this was already done earlier. We do not optimize the distortion of cam1 as that can result in incorrect values if there are not enough measurements at image periphery. The distortion is best optimized with the camera refiner (see below).</p>
<p>Optionally, one can try to further refine the calibration if not good enough when used with data collected while the bot is flying around doing inspection. This is an advanced topic which is handled further down this document, in the section on camera refinement.</p>

Data extraction</h2>
<p>Nav cam images can be extracted from a bag as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/localization_node/extract_image_bag       \
  mydata.bag -image_topic /mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record  \
  -output_directory nav_data -use_timestamp_as_image_name
</pre><p>The last option, <code>-use_timestamp_as_image_name</code>, must not be missed. It makes it easy to look up the image acquisition based on image name, and this is used by the geometry mapper.</p>
<p>One should check beforehand if the nav cam topic is correct. If the image sampler was not used, the nav cam topic would be /hw/cam_nav.</p>
<p>To extract the sci cam data, if necessary, do: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/localization_node/extract_image_bag \
 mydata.bag -image_topic /hw/cam_sci/compressed            \

</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
Map building and registration</h2>
<p>Build and register a SURF sparse map with the nav cam images. (This is needed only with real data.) See the <a href="https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/sparsemapping.html">sparse mapping</a> documentation in the Astrobee repository, with more details given in the <a href="https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/map_building.html">map building</a> page. <br  />
</p>
<p>If the map to be built is large, consider using the Theia SfM software. See the <a href="https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/theia_map.html">Theia documentation</a> for how to use this package to create Astrobee sparse maps.</p>
<p>An example for how to build a map in the context of calibration is also given further down this document.</p>
<p>This SURF map will be used with the geometry mapper. Rebuild it with BRISK features, to be used with the streaming mapper. Examine the BRISK obtained map. If it does not have enough features, rebuild it with a lower value of <code>--default_brisk_threshold</code> and <code>--max_brisk_threshold</code> (For example, use 70 instead of the default of</p><ol type="1">
<li>This may make the sparse map bigger.)</li>
</ol>
<p>It is suggested to not use the <code>--histogram_equalization</code> flag for the SURF map, but to use it with the BRISK map.</p>
<p>Don't forget to set: </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_ROBOT=&lt;robot name&gt;
</pre><p>and the other environmental variables from that document before running map-building.</p>
<p>It is very important to keep in the map at least one nav cam image whose timestamp is a couple of seconds before the sci cam image that we would like to later overlay on top of the mesh created with with the help of this map, and one nav cam image a couple of seconds after the last sci cam image we would like to keep, to ensure we process all sci cam images with the geometry mapper.</p>

Running the geometry mapper</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md77"></a>
When using real data</h2>
<p>The geometry mapper fuses the depth cloud data and creates textures from the image cameras.</p>
<p>Any image camera is supported, as long as present in the robot configuration file and a topic for it is in the bag file (see more details further down). The geometry mapper can handle both color and grayscale images, and, for sci cam, both full and reduced resolution.</p>

</pre><p>Parameters: </p><pre class="fragment">--ros_bag: A ROS bag with recorded image and point cloud data.
--sparse_map: A registered SURF sparse map of a subset of the nav_cam data.
--camera_types: Specify the cameras to use for the textures, as a list
  in quotes. Default: "sci_cam nav_cam haz_cam". With simulated
  data only ``sci_cam`` is supported.
--camera_topics: Specify the bag topics for the cameras to texture
  (in the same order as in ``--camera_types``). Use a list in quotes.
  The default is in the usage above.
--undistorted_crop_wins: The central region to keep after
  undistorting an image and before texturing. For sci_cam the
  numbers are at 1/4th of the full resolution (resolution of
  calibration) and will be adjusted for the actual input image
  dimensions. Use a list in quotes. The default is
  "sci_cam,1250,1000 nav_cam,1100,776 haz_cam,250,200".
--haz_cam_points_topic: The depth point cloud topic in the bag file.
--start: How many seconds into the bag to start processing the data.
--duration: For how many seconds to do the processing.
--sampling_spacing_seconds: How frequently to sample the sci and haz 
  cameras, in seconds. The default is 2.
--dist_between_processed_cams: Once an image or depth cloud is processed, 
  process a new one whenever either the camera moves by more than this 
  distance, in meters, or the angle changes by more than 
  --angle_between_processed_cams, in degrees. The default is 0.1.
--angle_between_processed_cams: See --dist_between_processed_cams. The
  default is 5.0. 
--sci_cam_timestamps: Process only these sci cam timestamps (rather than 
  any in the bag using --dist_between_processed_cams, etc.). Must be 
  a file with one timestamp per line. 
--depth_exclude_columns: Remove this many columns of data from the 
  rectangular depth image sensor at margins to avoid distortion.
  The default is 0.
--depth_exclude_rows: Remove this many columns of data from the 
  rectangular depth image sensor at margins to avoid distortion.
  The default is 0.
--foreshortening_delta: A smaller value here will result in holes
  in depth images being filled more aggressively but potentially
  with more artifacts in foreshortened regions. Works only with
  positive --depth_hole_fill_diameter.
--median_filters: Given a list "w1 d1 w2 d2 ... ", remove a depth
  image point if it differs, in the Manhattan norm, from the median
  of cloud points in the pixel window of size wi centered at it by
  more than di. This removes points sticking out for each such
  i. The default is "7 0.1 25 0.1".
--depth_hole_fill_diameter: Fill holes in the depth point clouds
  with this diameter, in pixels. This happens before the clouds are
  fused. If set to a positive value it can fill really big holes but
  may introduce artifacts. It is better to leave the hole-filling
  for later, once the mesh is fused (see --max_hole_diameter).
  The default is 0.
--reliability_weight_exponent: A larger value will give more
  weight to depth points corresponding to pixels closer to depth
  image center, which are considered more reliable. The default is
  2.0.
--max_ray_length_m: Dictates at what distance from the depth camera
  to truncate the rays (in meters). This can be small if the images
  are acquired close to walls and facing them.
--voxblox_integrator: When fusing the depth point clouds use
  this VoxBlox method. Options are: "merged", "simple", and
  "fast". The default is "merged".
--voxel_size: The grid size used for binning depth cloud points and 
  creating the mesh. Measured in meters.
--max_iso_times_exposure: Apply the inverse gamma transform to
  images, multiply them by max_iso_times_exposure/ISO/exposure_time
  to adjust for lightning differences, then apply the gamma
  transform back. This value should be set to the maximum observed
  ISO * exposure_time. The default is 5.1. Not used with simulated data.
--smoothing_time: A larger value will result in a smoother mesh. The 
  default is 0.00005.
--no_boundary_erosion: Do not erode the boundary when smoothing
  the mesh. Erosion may help with making the mesh more regular and
  easier to hole-fill, but may be undesirable in regions which
  don't get to be hole-filled.
--max_num_hole_edges: Close holes in the mesh which have no more
  than this many edges. The default is 1000.
--max_hole_diameter: The diameter (in meters) of the largest hole
  in the mesh to fill. The default is 0.3.
--num_min_faces_in_component: Keep only connected mesh components with 
  at least this many faces.
--num_components_to_keep: How many of the largest connected components 
  of the mesh to keep. Being too aggressive here can result in a mesh 
  with missing parts. The default is 10.
--edge_keep_ratio: Simply the mesh keeping only this fraction of
  the original edges. The default is 0.2.
--max_texture_size: The maximum size (in pixels) of each texture
  file created for the produced textured mesh. The default is 2048.
--output_dir: The directory where to write the processed data.
--simulated_data: If specified, use data recorded in simulation. 
  Then haz and sci camera poses and intrinsics should be recorded in the 
  bag file (see earlier about recording simulated data).
--localization_options: Options to to use to localize the nav cam images.
  These mostly relate to the SURF (or BRISK parameters). Default: 
  '--min_surf_features 400 --max_surf_features 600 --min_surf_threshold 5 -default_surf_threshold 10 --max_surf_threshold 1000 --early_break_landmarks 400 -verbose_localization'. 
--use_brisk_map: If this flag is specified, instead of a SURF sparse map 
  made from the same bag that needs texturing, use a pre-existing and 
  unrelated BRISK map. This map may be more convenient but less
  reliable. In this case one must specify carefully the range of
  times in the bag to use as it will no longer be constrained by
  the timestamps in the map.
--start_step: Start processing at this step. Useful for resuming
  work. Values: 0 (determine poses), 1 (fuse meshes), 2 (smoothe
  mesh), 3 (fill holes), 4 (clean mesh and rm small connected
  components), 5 (smoothe again), 6 (fill holes again), 7 (smoothe again),
  8 (simplify the mesh), 9 (texture mesh).
--merge_maps: Given several output geometry mapper directories, specified 
  as a list in quotes, create a merged textured mesh. The input
  bag and sparse map will not be used. Each input geometry mapper run
  can have its own bag and sparse map. The sparse maps must be
  registered to a global coordinate system and co-registered to
  each other, such as when extracted from a larger merged and
  registered map.
--external_mesh: Use this mesh to texture the images, rather than
  creating one from depth data in the current bag.
--nav_cam_to_sci_cam_offset_override_value: Override the
  value of nav_cam_to_sci_cam_timestamp_offset from the robot config
  file with this value.
--verbose: If specified, echo all output in the terminal.
--texture_individual_images: If specified, in addition to a joint texture 
  of all images create individual textures for each image and camera. Does 
  not work with simulated cameras. For debugging.
--save_debug_data: If specified, save many intermediate datasets
  for debugging.
</pre><p>The outputs produced by this tool are four meshes that can be visualized with Meshlab:</p>
<ul>
<li>data_dir/fused_mesh.ply: A mesh obtained by fusing the haz cam depth point clouds.</li>
<li>data_dir/smooth_mesh.ply: A smoothed version of the mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/hole_filled_mesh.ply: A mesh obtained by filling holes in the fused mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/clean_mesh.ply: The mesh with small connected components removed.</li>
<li>data_dir/smooth_mesh2.ply: A further smoothed version of the mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/hole_filled_mesh2.ply: A further hole-filled mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/simplified_mesh.ply: The simplified mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/smooth_mesh3.ply: A further smoothed version of the mesh.</li>
<li>data_dir/sci_cam_texture/run.obj: The mesh overlayed with the sci cam texture.</li>
<li>data_dir/nav_cam_texture/run.obj: The mesh overlayed with the nav cam texture.</li>
<li>data_dir/haz_cam_texture/run.obj: The mesh overlayed with the haz cam texture.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Several passes of smoothing and hole-filling, as done above, appear necessary from experiments.)</p>
<p>Intermediate products are the undistorted nav cam and sci cam images. It is suggested to review those in an image viewer, such as 'eog' and delete some of them if they cause artifacts. After that, the last part of the pipeline (invocation of the texrecon tool) can be redone.</p>
<p>To run this tool it is suggested to pick a portion of the bag where the images face the wall as much as possible, so one may need to change the <code>--start</code> and <code>--duration</code> values.</p>
<p>Unless the flag <code>--use_brisk_map</code> is set, the data processing will be restricted to the range of timestamps contained within the sparse map (this is another restriction, in addition to <code>--start</code> and <code>--duration</code>`).</p>
<p>If this tool is too slow, or if localization fails, consider adjusting the <code>--localization_options</code> above. For example, to make localization work better (which will make the program slower) decrease the value of <code>--default_surf_threshold</code>, and increase <code>--early_break_landmarks</code>, <code>--min_surf_features</code>, and <code>--max_surf_features</code>. To make it faster, do the opposite.</p>
<p>The values of <code>--depth_exclude_columns</code> and <code>--depth_exclude_rows</code> can be adjusted to remove rows and columns at the margins which may result in a nicer mesh. If, for example, the bot moves upwards or downwards, there is little loss in removing some rows at the margins as they will be filled in from other depth readings. Then, if there are several up-down scans with good lateral overlap, removing some columns won't result in much loss but may remove some noise.</p>
<p>If it is desired to use only a precise subset of the sci cam images, specify those with the option <code>--sci_cam_timestamps</code>.</p>
<p>If several acquisitions were performed, and the geometry mapper was run with each of them, those can be merged by invoking the geometry mapper with the option <code>--merge_maps</code>.</p>
<p>The geometry mapper can run with a previously created mesh if invoked with the option <code>--external_mesh</code>.</p>
<p>The most time-consuming part of the geometry mapper is computing the initial poses, which is the earliest step, or step 0. To resume the geometry mapper at any step, use the option <code>--start_step num</code>. For example, one may want to apply further smoothing to the mesh or more hole-filling, before resuming with the next steps.</p>
<p>For a given camera type to be textured it must have entries in <code>cameras.config</code> and the robot config file (such as <code>bumble.config</code>), which are analogous to existing <code>nav_cam_to_sci_cam_timestamp_offset</code>, <code>nav_cam_to_sci_cam_transform</code>, and <code>sci_cam</code> intrinsics, with "sci" replaced by your camera name. The geometry mapper arguments <code>--camera_types</code>, <code>--camera_topics</code>, and <code>--undistorted_crop_wins</code> must be populated accordingly, with some careful choice to be made for the last one. Images for the desired camera must be present in the bag file at the the specified topic.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md78"></a>
With simulated data</h2>
<p>The geometry mapper works with any simulated cameras not having distortion. It was tested to work with simulated images for <code>sci_cam</code>, <code>haz_cam</code>, <code>heat_cam</code>, and <code>acoustics_cam</code>. It does not work with <code>nav_cam</code>, which has distortion.</p>
<p>The flag: </p><pre class="fragment">--simulated_data
</pre><p>should be passed to the geometry mapper. The sparse map is not necessary, no localization will take place, and intrinsics information, camera transform, and timestamp offset will not be read from the robot configuration file. Instead, it is expected that each simulated camera, for example <code>sci_cam</code>, will provide, in addition to an image topic, the topics </p><pre class="fragment">/sim/sci_cam/pose
/sim/sci_cam/info
</pre><p>having the pose and intrinsics of each camera image. These should be recorded in the bag (see more on recording earlier in the document).</p>
<p>It is assumed that the simulated images are not distorted. In particular, <code>nav_cam</code>, which has fisheye lens distortion, is not supported.</p>
<p>The simulated haz_cam is required to be among the topics being recorded and read in, because its pose is needed to process the depth clouds.</p>

Running the streaming mapper</h2>
<p>Here we assume that the geometry mapper ran and created a dense 3D model of the region of interest. Then, the robot is run, whether in simulation or in the real world. It records images with a camera, which can be sci cam, nav cam, etc. (see the complete list below), that we call the "texture images".</p>
<p>The streaming mapper ROS node will then overlay each texture image received with this camera on top of the 3D model, and publish the obtained textured model to be visualized.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md80"></a>
Running with real data</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md81"></a>
When the robot (or nav cam) poses are known</h4>
<p>To run the streaming mapper with real data for the given bot, do: </p><pre class="fragment">source $ASTROBEE_WS/devel/setup.bash
source $ISAAC_WS/devel/setup.bash
export ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/resources
export ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config
export ASTROBEE_WORLD=iss
export ASTROBEE_ROBOT=bsharp2
roslaunch isaac isaac_astrobee.launch llp:=disabled nodes:=framestore \
  streaming_mapper:=true output:=screen     
</pre><p>Wait until it finishes forming the texture model, which may take 30 seconds, or up to 3 minutes for very large meshes.</p>
<p>Ensure that the <code>ASTROBEE_ROBOT</code> name is correct above.</p>
<p>This node will load the mesh produced by the geometry mapper from </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/src/isaac/resources/geometry/${ASTROBEE_WORLD}.ply
</pre><p>If an updated geometry mapper mesh exists, it should be copied to that location first.</p>
<p>The tool will read the configuration options from: </p><pre class="fragment">$ISAAC_WS/src/isaac/config/dense_map/streaming_mapper.config
</pre><p>By default, as specified in that file, it will listen to the robot body pose being published at: </p><pre class="fragment">/gnc/ekf
</pre><p>That config file specifies the the camera image to texture, which, by default, is <code>sci_cam</code>. Its image topic must be set, which, for <code>sci_cam</code> is normally </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_sci/compressed
</pre><p>while for <code>haz_cam</code> is: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int
</pre><p>For <code>nav_cam</code> the image topic is either </p><pre class="fragment">/mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record
</pre><p>if the images are played from a bag which recorded the images produced with the image sampler, or </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/cam_nav
</pre><p>if no image sampler was used. The rest of the cameras usually follow the convention on the line above, for example, the <code>heat_cam</code> topic is <code>/hw/cam_heat</code>.</p>
<p>For the sci cam, the streaming mapper also expects image exposure data on the topic: </p><pre class="fragment">/hw/sci_cam_exif
</pre><p>to do exposure correction, unless in simulation mode or <code>sci_cam_exposure_correction</code> is set to false. This is not needed for other cameras.</p>
<p>In order for the streaming mapper to produce texture it should receive input information with its needed topics (robot or nav_cam pose and the image to texture), either from a bag or from the robot in real time. A data bag can be played with the usual command: </p><pre class="fragment">rosbag play data.bag
</pre><p>See the note further down if it is desired to rename the topics on which some bag data is published.</p>
<p>The streaming mapper will publish several topics having texture information, which for <code>sci_cam</code> are: </p><pre class="fragment">/ism/sci_cam/img
/ism/sci_cam/obj
/ism/sci_cam/mtl
</pre><p>and an analogous convention is followed for other cameras.</p>
<p>The header.stamp value for each published message will be the same as the header.stamp for the corresponding input camera image.</p>
<p>The data produced by the streaming mapper can be recorded (for sci_cam, and analogously for other cameras) with: </p><pre class="fragment">rosbag record /ism/sci_cam/img /ism/sci_cam/obj /ism/sci_cam/mtl \
   -b 10000
</pre><p>The recording should start before the input bag is played. The <code>-b</code> option tells ROS to increase its recording buffer size, as sometimes the streaming mapper can publish giant meshes.</p>
<p>The robot pose that the streaming mapper needs assumes a very accurate calibration of the IMU sensor in addition to the nav, haz, and sci cam sensors, and very accurate knowledge of the pose of these sensors on the robot body. If that is not the case, it is suggested to use the nav cam pose via the <code>nav_cam_pose_topic</code> field in streaming_mapper.config (set it to <code>/loc/ml/features</code>), for which only accurate calibration of the nav, sci, and haz cameras among each other is assumed, while the <code>ekf_pose_topic</code> must be set to an empty string.</p>
<p>The input texture can be in color or grayscale, at full or reduced resolution, and compressed or not.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md82"></a>
Running with no robot or nav cam pose information</h4>
<p>If no robot body or nav cam pose information is present, for example, if the EKF or localization node was not running when the image data was acquired, or this data was not recorded or was not reliable, the localization node can be started together with the streaming mapper, and this node will provide updated pose information.</p>
<p>Edit <code>streaming_mapper.config</code> and set <code>nav_cam_pose_topic</code> to <code>/loc/ml/features</code> and let <code>ekf_state_topic</code> be empty.</p>
<p>The localization node will make use of a registered sparse map with BRISK features, histogram equalization, and a vocabulary database to find the nav cam poses. The command for building such a BRISK map from a registered SURF map is: </p><pre class="fragment">cp surf_map.map brisk_map.map 
$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/sparse_mapping/build_map                 \
  --output_map brisk_map.map --rebuild --histogram_equalization \
  --vocab_db
</pre><p>See: </p><pre class="fragment"> $ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/localization/sparse_mapping/readme.md
</pre><p>for more information.</p>
<p>If running on a local machine, after the map is rebuilt it should be copied to: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR/maps/${ASTROBEE_WORLD}.map
</pre><p>(The <code>maps</code> directory needs to be created if missing.)</p>
<p>Also see a note earlier in the text for how to reduce the BRISK thresholds if the map has too few features. For more details on what the localization node expects, see build_map.md, in the section about running this node on a local machine.</p>
<p>Ensure the same environment as before is present, including the robot name, and run: </p><pre class="fragment">roslaunch isaac isaac_astrobee.launch mlp:=local llp:=disabled \
  nodes:=framestore,localization_node streaming_mapper:=true   \
  output:=screen     
</pre><p>Wait until the textured model is created, which can take a minute.</p>
<p>Then, in a different terminal, play the bag. The localization node will expect the nav cam images to be published on topic <code>/hw/cam_nav</code>. If it is on a different topic, such as <code>/mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record</code>, it needs to be redirected to this one when playing the bag, such as: </p><pre class="fragment">rosbag play --clock data.bag                         \
  /mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record:=/hw/cam_nav \
  /loc/ml/features:=/tmp/features /gnc/ekf:=/tmp/ekf
</pre><p>Above the /loc/ml/features and /gnc/ekf topics which may exist in the bag are redirected to temporary topics, since the currently started localization node will create new camera pose information.</p>
<p>The <code>--clock</code> option should not be missed.</p>
<p>Then enable the localization node by running in a separate terminal: </p><pre class="fragment">rosservice call /loc/ml/enable true
</pre><h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md83"></a>
The streaming mapper configuration file</h4>
<p>The <code>streaming_mapper.config</code> file has following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>mesh_file: Override the location of the mesh described earlier.</li>
<li>ekf_state_topic: The topic to listen to for robot pose information. It can be set to /gnc/ekf, whose type is ff_msgs::EkfState.</li>
<li>ekf_pose_topic: An alternative topic for the robot pose. It can be set to /loc/pose, of type geometry_msgs::PoseStamped.</li>
<li>nav_cam_pose_topic: The preferred topic for the pose. This is the pose of the nav cam, not of the robot, and can be set to /loc/ml/features. It is published by the localization node.</li>
<li>texture_cam_type: The camera that creates the texture images (can be nav_cam, sci_cam, haz_cam, and in simulation also heat_cam and acoustics_cam). The default is sci_cam. This field affects the name of the topics on which the streaming mapper publishes its output.</li>
<li>texture_cam_topic: The topic having the images (texture) to overlay. The default value is /hw/cam_sci/compressed and see note in the text for other cameras.</li>
<li>dist_between_processed_cams: Once an image is textured and published, process a new one whenever either the camera moves by more than this distance, in meters, or the angle changes by more than angle_between_processed_cams, in degrees. The default is 0.1.</li>
<li>angle_between_processed_cams: See: dist_between_processed_cams. The default is 5.0.</li>
<li>max_iso_times_exposure: Apply the inverse gamma transform to images, multiply them by max_iso_times_exposure/ISO/exposure_time to adjust for lightning differences, then apply the gamma transform back. This value should be set to the maximum observed ISO * exposure_time. The default is 5.1. Not used with simulated data, when sci_cam_exposure_correction if false, or other cameras than sci_cam.</li>
<li>sci_cam_exposure_correction: If set to 'true', correct the exposure of sci_cam images. Read exposures from /hw/sci_cam_exif.</li>
<li>use_single_texture: If set to 'true', use a single texture buffer. Sample the images by picking points on each triangle face with spacing pixel_size. This can take a couple of minutes to form the necessary structures to be able to stream the texture.</li>
<li>pixel_size: The pixel size to use with use_single_texture. The default is 0.001 meters.</li>
<li>num_threads: Number of threads to use. The default is 48.</li>
<li>save_to_disk: If set to 'true', save to disk an .obj file for each topic published, to be debugged in Meshlab. These will be saved in ~/.ros. The default is 'false'.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md84"></a>
Running with simulated data</h2>
<p>For simulated data the usage is somewhat different. First, simulation.config needs to be edited as described earlier in the document to turn on the simulated sci cam, haz cam, or other desired camera.</p>
<p>When working with ISS data, more specifically the JPM module, do: </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_WORLD=iss
/bin/cp -fv $ISAAC_WS/src/isaac/resources/geometry/iss_sim.ply \
  $ISAAC_WS/src/isaac/resources/geometry/${ASTROBEE_WORLD}.ply
</pre><p>to use the simulated mesh for this module.</p>
<p>Edit <code>streaming_mapper.config</code> and set: </p><pre class="fragment">use_single_texture = false;
</pre><p>Otherwise, the exiting simulated mesh has so many triangles that it will overwhelm the size of the single buffer which is meant to fit all textures.</p>
<p>To launch the streaming mapper, do: </p><pre class="fragment">source $ASTROBEE_WS/devel/setup.bash
source $ISAAC_WS/devel/setup.bash
export ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/resources
export ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config
export ASTROBEE_WORLD=iss
roslaunch isaac sim.launch world:=iss rviz:=true        \
  streaming_mapper:=true pose:="11.0 -7.0 5.0 0 0 0 1"  \
  output:=screen 
</pre><p>It is suggested to read the documentation above for working with the simulator in the context of the geometry mapper for more details, such as how to ensure the desired camera images are seen in rviz.</p>
<p>Then, the robot can be moved in order to create images to texture as: </p><pre class="fragment">rosrun mobility teleop -move -pos "11.0 -5.0 5.0" -tolerance_pos 0.0001 \
  -att "0 0 0 1"
</pre><p>With simulated data the pose and intrinsics for each camera are received directly from the simulator, on topics that, for example, for sci_cam, are: </p><pre class="fragment">/sim/sci_cam/pose
/sim/sci_cam/info
</pre><p>Hence, the parameters <code>ekf_state_topic</code>, <code>ekf_pose_topic</code>, and <code>nav_cam_pose_topic</code> are ignored.</p>
<p>The streaming mapper will publish its results on topics mentioned earlier in the text.</p>
<p>Note that value of <code>ASTROBEE_ROBOT</code> is not needed in this case. Any user-set value will be overwritten with the robot name <code>sim</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md85"></a>
Camera refinement</h2>
<p>The calibration done with the calibration target can still leave some residual registration error between the cameras, which manifests itself as discrepancies in the geometry mapper and streaming mapper products, and between the nav cam and sci cam textures.</p>
<p>Once a dataset of the robot flying around and performing inspections is acquired, so in realistic conditions, rather than with a calibration target, it can be used to further refine the camera calibration file, including the intrinsics and extrinsics.</p>
<p>The calibration step above can be avoided altogether, and this robot's desired transforms to be refined can be initialized with values from a different robot or with the placeholder values already present in a given robot's config file.</p>
<p>To avoid issues with accuracy of the timestamps of the images, we assume that the robot is paused, or otherwise moves very slowly, during each sci cam shot. Then, to refine the camera calibration, the following approach should be taken.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md86"></a>
Image selection</h3>
<p>Select a set of nav cam images shortly before and after each sci cam image using the image_picker tool: </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_RESOURCE_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/resources
export ASTROBEE_CONFIG_DIR=$ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH/astrobee/config
export ASTROBEE_WORLD=iss
export ASTROBEE_ROBOT=bsharp2

  --ros_bag mybag.bag                                            \
  --nav_cam_topic /mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record          \
  --sci_cam_topic /hw/cam_sci/compressed                         \
  --haz_cam_intensity_topic /hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int \
  --bracket_len 0.6 --output_nav_cam_dir nav_images
</pre><p>Setting up the correct robot name for ASTROBEE_ROBOT is very important.</p>
<p>The &ndash;bracket_len option brackets sci cam images by nav cam images so the length of time between these two nav cam images is at most this value. These nav cam images are saved. Later in camera_refiner sci cam and haz cam images are picked in each such a nav cam interval. (A camera's time is first adjusted for the timestamp offset between the cameras.)</p>
<p>It is important to note that the bracket length can affect the accuracy of calibration later, and hence it should be rather tight. Yet a tight bracket does not allow for wiggle room if later it is desired to tweak a little the timestamp offsets while still staying within the bounds, and it may prevent bracketing all the sci cam images and enough haz cam images.</p>
<p>The option &ndash;nav_cam_to_sci_cam_offset_override_value can be used if the given bag is suspected to have a different value of this offset. Such an option the option can be passed also to the camera refiner below and to the geometry mapper.</p>
<p>Examine these images. Since they are used for bracketing, there will be pairs of very similar images. Yet, it is good that there should be no excessive overlap otherwise, so the images in the first pair better have about 4/5 overlap with images from other pairs.</p>
<p>If necessary, add more intermediate images by re-running this tool with: </p><pre class="fragment">--max_dist_between_images &lt;val&gt;
</pre><p>It is good to not allow too many images or excessive overlap, but, if removing excessive images, ensure that each sci cam image is still bracketed as originally by two nav cam images close in time, and keep the images in pairs of very similar ones. That is good even if there's no sci cam images between some pairs, as it is likely haz cam images are found later in that bracket.</p>
<p>One could start by running this tool with the &ndash;max_dist_between_images option, wiping many redundant images while ensuring there is good overlap among them and keeping pairs of similar images, then running this tool one more time without this option to ensure the bracketing images for each sci cam image are added back.</p>
<p>The option &ndash;left_bracket_only will generate the left brackets only, this might be useful if you want to minimize images in the map-making process, but be sure to merge the remaining images in a later stage.</p>
<p>To save a log file with with a specific name containing the generated pictures path use: </p><pre class="fragment">--logfile &lt;str&gt;
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md87"></a>
Map building and registration</h3>
<p>Build a sparse map with these images. Use the same environment as above: </p><pre class="fragment">dir=nav_images
images=$(ls $dir/*jpg)
surf_map=${dir}_surf.map
$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/sparse_mapping/build_map                 \
  --output_map $surf_map --feature_detection --feature_matching \
  --track_building --incremental_ba  --bundle_adjustment        \
  --min_valid_angle 1.0 --num_subsequent_images 20 $images 
</pre><p>Notice how we used "--min_valid_angle 1.0". The two images used for each sci cam and haz cam bracketing will be very similar, and this will prevent having too many features which result in small convergence angles between the rays, which may make map-building less stable.</p>
<p>If the map makes a closed loop, and, for example, image 80 becomes similar to image 0, one should increase &ndash;num_subsequent_images to perhaps 90. This would result in increased runtime but a better map.</p>
<p>Register the map. That can be done, for example, by merging this map with a registered map, bundle-adjusting the obtained map, re-registering it, then extracting the submap corresponding to the original images without re-bundle-adjusting the extracted submap to maintain the same coordinate system as after registration.</p>
<p>This process can be time-consuming. A trick which can speed things up is to extract a smaller but representative submap from the registered map, say showing all the walls as our map, and merge and register our map to this registered submap. That goes as follows.</p>
<p>Examine the existing registered map in nvm_visualize and record in a list named <code>list.txt</code> the images which are similar to the ones in the map we want to register, one per line (those are printed on the screen as one navigates through the map in the viewer). A submap of the registered map can then be extracted, without bundle-adjustment (to not affect the registration) as: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/sparse_mapping/extract_submap       \
  --skip_bundle_adjustment --input_map registered_map.map  \
  --output_map registered_submap.map                       \
  --skip_bundle_adjustment                                 \
  $(cat list.txt)
</pre><p>If desired, this can be rebuilt to ensure it is created with the same options as the map we want. That can be done as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">build_map --rebuild --rebuild_detector SURF \
  --output_map registered_submap.map
</pre><p>(This does not affect the camera positions and hence the registration.)</p>
<p>Our map can be merged into this map without modifying the first map, and hence keeping its registration, as: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/sparse_mapping/merge_maps \
  --fix_first_map                                \

  registered_submap.map $surf_map                \
  --output_map merged.map
</pre><p>The desired now-registered map can then be extracted as: </p><pre class="fragment">$ASTROBEE_WS/devel/lib/sparse_mapping/extract_submap      \

Running camera_refiner</h3>

</pre><p>Here it was chosen to pass in a mesh from a previous invocation of the geometry mapper for this robot and the given registered sparse map (for example, the <code>fused.ply</code> mesh can be used). That is optional, and it is needed only one adds to camera_refiner the constraints that the triangulated points and haz cam clouds stay close to the mesh, when positive values should be used for <code>--mesh_tri_weight</code> and <code>--depth_mesh_weight</code>, and if desired to use the option <code>--out_texture_dir</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes such a mesh can help with convergence, but should not be used in a first attempt at calibration. It was not used for the final bumble robot calibration, when the weights were as above, but was used for the bsharp2 robot, when all three weights above were set to 25.</p>
<p>Note that sometimes it is desired to not change the nav_cam intrinsics, such as for the bumble robot, as existing ISS maps depend on it, and then one should set <code>--nav_cam_intrinsics_to_float ""</code> above.</p>
<p>We used the same bracket length as in the image picker. It is very important to note that a tight bracket should be used, as, if the robot moves fast and the bracket value is big, it can affect the accuracy of calibration.

</pre><p>These can be helpful in figuring out if the calibration result is good. The errors whose name ends in "_m" are in meters and measure the absolute differences between the depth clouds and mesh (depth_mesh), between depth clouds and triangulated points (depth_tri), and between mesh points and triangulated points (mesh_tri), in x, y, and z, respectively. The <code>mesh</code> residuals will be printed only if a mesh is passed on input and if the mesh-related weights are positive. Some outliers are unavoidable, hence some of these numbers can be big even if the calibration overall does well (the robust threshold does not allow outliers to dominate).</p>
<p>A source of errors (apart from inaccurate intrinsics, extrinsics, or insufficiently good modeling of the cameras) can be the nav_cam_to_sci_cam_timestamp_offset, which can be non-zero if the HLP and MLP/LLP processors are not synchronized (the sci_cam pictures are acquired with the HLP and nav_cam with MLP/LLP). If this value is not known well, this tool can be run with zero or more iterations and various values of: </p><pre class="fragment">--nav_cam_to_sci_cam_offset_override_value &lt;val&gt;
</pre><p>to see which value gives the smallest residuals.</p>
<p>If the <code>--out_texture_dir</code> option is specified, the tool will create textured meshes for each image and optimized camera at the end. Ideally those textured meshes will agree among each other.</p>

Camera refiner options</h3>
<p>This program's options are: </p><pre class="fragment">--ros_bag (string, default = "")
  A ROS bag with recorded nav_cam, haz_cam intensity,
  full-resolution sci_cam, and haz_cam depth clouds.

--sparse_map (string, default = "")
  A registered SURF sparse map made with some of the ROS bag data,
  including nav cam images closely bracketing the sci cam
  images.

--output_map (string, default = "")
  Output file containing the updated map.

--nav_cam_topic (string, default = "/mgt/img_sampler/nav_cam/image_record")
  The nav cam topic in the bag file.

--haz_cam_intensity_topic (string, default = "/hw/depth_haz/extended/amplitude_int")
  The depth camera intensity topic in the bag file.

--sci_cam_topic (string, default = "/hw/cam_sci/compressed")
  The sci cam topic in the bag file.

--haz_cam_points_topic (string, default = "/hw/depth_haz/points")
  The depth point cloud topic in the bag file.

--num_overlaps (int32, default = 10)
  How many images (of all camera types) close and forward in time
  to match to given image.

--max_haz_cam_image_to_depth_timestamp_diff (double, default = 0.2)
  Use a haz cam depth cloud only if it is within this distance in
  time from a given haz cam intensity image.

--robust_threshold (double, default = 3.0)
  Residual pixel errors and 3D point residuals (the latter multiplied
  by corresponding weight) much larger than this will be
  exponentially attenuated to affect less the cost function.

--num_iterations (int32, default = 20)
  How many solver iterations to perform in calibration.

--bracket_len (double, default = 0.6)
  Lookup sci and haz cam images only between consecutive nav cam
  images whose distance in time is no more than this (in seconds),
  after adjusting for the timestamp offset between these
  cameras. It is assumed the robot moves slowly and uniformly
  during this time. A large value here will make the refiner
  compute a poor solution but a small value will prevent enough
  sci_cam images being bracketed.

--nav_cam_intrinsics_to_float (string, default = "")
  Refine given nav_cam intrinsics. Specify as a quoted list. For
  example: 'focal_length optical_center distortion'.

--haz_cam_intrinsics_to_float (string, default = "")
  Refine given haz_cam intrinsics. Specify as a quoted list. For
  example: 'focal_length optical_center distortion'.

--sci_cam_intrinsics_to_float (string, default = "")
  Refine given sci_cam intrinsics. Specify as a quoted list. For
  example: 'focal_length optical_center distortion'.

--extrinsics_to_float (string, default = "haz_cam sci_cam depth_to_image")
  Specify the cameras whose extrinsics to float, relative to
  nav_cam. Also consider if to float the haz_cam depth_to_image
  transform.

--float_scale (bool, false unless specified)
  If to optimize the scale of the clouds, part of
  haz_cam_depth_to_image_transform (use it if the sparse map is
  kept fixed, or else rescaling and registration of the map and
  extrinsics is needed). This parameter should not be used with
  --affine_depth_to_image when the transform is affine, rather
  than rigid and a scale. See also --extrinsics_to_float.

--float_sparse_map (bool, false unless specified)
  Optimize the sparse map. This should be avoided as it can
  invalidate the scales of the extrinsics and the registration. It
  should at least be used with big mesh weights to attenuate those
  effects. See also: --registration.

--float_timestamp_offsets (bool, false unless specified)
  If to optimize the timestamp offsets among the cameras.

--nav_cam_num_exclude_boundary_pixels (int32, default = 0)
  Flag as outliers nav cam pixels closer than this to the
  boundary, and ignore that boundary region when texturing with
  the --out_texture_dir option. This may improve the calibration
  accuracy, especially if switching from fisheye to radtan
  distortion for nav_cam. See also the geometry_mapper
  --undistorted_crop_wins option.

--timestamp_offsets_max_change (double, default = 1.0)
  If floating the timestamp offsets, do not let them change by
  more than this (measured in seconds). Existing image bracketing
  acts as an additional constraint.

--nav_cam_to_sci_cam_offset_override_value (double, default = NaN)
  Override the value of nav_cam_to_sci_cam_timestamp_offset from
  the robot config file with this value.

--sci_cam_timestamps (string, default = "")
  Use only these sci cam timestamps. Must be a file with one
  timestamp per line.

--depth_tri_weight (double, default = 1000.0)
  The weight to give to the constraint that depth measurements
  agree with triangulated points. Use a bigger number as depth
  errors are usually on the order of 0.01 meters while
  reprojection errors are on the order of 1 pixel.

--mesh (string, default = "")
  Use this geometry mapper mesh from a previous geometry mapper
  run to help constrain the calibration. E.g., use fused_mesh.ply.

--mesh_tri_weight (double, default = 0.0)
  A larger value will give more weight to the constraint that
  triangulated points stay close to a preexisting mesh. Not
  suggested by default.

--depth_mesh_weight (double, default = 0.0)
  A larger value will give more weight to the constraint that the
  depth clouds stay close to the mesh. Not suggested by default.

--affine_depth_to_image (bool, false unless specified)
  Assume that the depth_to_image_transform for each depth + image
  camera is an arbitrary affine transform rather than a rotation
  times a scale.

--refiner_num_passes (int32, default = 2)
  How many passes of optimization to do. Outliers will be removed
  after every pass. Each pass will start with the previously
  optimized solution as an initial guess. Mesh intersections (if
  applicable) and ray triangulation will be recomputed before each
  pass.

--initial_max_reprojection_error (double, default = 300.0)
  If filtering outliers, remove interest points for which the
  reprojection error, in pixels) is larger than this. This
  filtering happens when matches are created, before cameras are
  optimized) and a big value should be used if the initial cameras
  are not trusted.

--max_reprojection_error (double, default = 25.0)
  If filtering outliers, remove interest points for which the
  reprojection error, in pixels) is larger than this. This
  filtering happens after each optimization pass finishes, unless
  disabled. It is better to not filter too aggressively unless
  confident in the solution.

--refiner_min_angle (double, default = 0.5)
  If filtering outliers, remove triangulated points for which all
  rays converging to it make an angle (in degrees) less than this.
  Note that some cameras in the rig may be very close to each
  other relative to the triangulated points, so care is needed
  here.

--out_texture_dir (string, default = "")
  If non-empty and if an input mesh was provided, project the
  camera images using the optimized poses onto the mesh and write
  the obtained .obj files in the given directory.

--min_ray_dist (double, default = 0.0)
  The minimum search distance from a starting point along a ray
  when intersecting the ray with a mesh, in meters (if
  applicable).

--max_ray_dist (double, default = 100.0)
  The maximum search distance from a starting point along a ray
  when intersecting the ray with a mesh, in meters (if
  applicable).

--nav_cam_distortion_replacement (string, default = "")
  Replace nav_cam's distortion coefficients with this list after
  the initial determination of triangulated points, and then
  continue with distortion optimization. A quoted list of four or
  five values expected, separated by spaces, as the replacement
  distortion model will have radial and tangential
  coefficients. Set a positive
  --nav_cam_num_exclude_boundary_pixels.

--registration (bool, false unless specified)
  If true, and registration control points for the sparse map
  exist and are specified by --hugin_file and --xyz_file,
  re-register the sparse map at the end. All the extrinsics,
  including depth_to_image_transform, will be scaled accordingly.
  This is not needed if the nav_cam intrinsics and the sparse map
  do not change.

--hugin_file (string, default = "")
  The path to the hugin .pto file used for sparse map
  registration.

--xyz_file (string, default = "")
  The path to the xyz file used for sparse map registration.

--parameter_tolerance (double, default = 1e-12)
  Stop when the optimization variables change by less than this.

--num_opt_threads (int32, default = 16)
  How many threads to use in the optimization.

--num_match_threads (int32, default = 8)
  How many threads to use in feature detection/matching.
  A large number can use a lot of memory.

--verbose (bool, false unless specified)
  Print the residuals and save the images and match files. Stereo
  Pipeline's viewer can be used for visualizing these.
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md91"></a>
Using the refiner with a radtan model for nav_cam</h3>
<p>The camera refiner supports using a radtan distortion model for nav_cam, that is a model with radial and and tangential distortion, just like for haz_cam and sci_cam, but the default nav_cam distortion model is fisheye. One can edit the robot config file and replace the fisheye model with a desired radial + tangential distortion model (4 or 5 coefficients are needed) then run the refiner.</p>
<p>Since it is not easy to find a good initial set of such coefficients, the refiner has the option of computing such a model which best fits the given fisheye model. For that, the refiner is started with the fisheye model, this model is used to set up the problem, including triangulating the 3D points after feature detection, then the fisheye model is replaced on-the-fly with desired 4 or 5 coefficients of the radtan model via the option &ndash;nav_cam_distortion_replacement, to which one can pass, for example, "0 0 0 0". These coefficients will then be optimized while keeping the rest of the variables fixed (nav cam focal length and optical center, intrinsics of other cameras, and all the extrinsics). The new best-fit distortion model will be written to disk at the end, replacing the fisheye model, and from then on the new model can be used for further calibration experiments just as with the fisheye model.</p>
<p>It may however be needed to rerun the refiner one more time, this time with the new distortion model read from disk, and still keep all intrinsics and extrinsics (including the sparse map and depth to image) fixed, except for the nav cam distortion, to fully tighten it.</p>
<p>Since it is expected that fitting such a model is harder at the periphery, where the distortion is stronger, the camera refiner has the option <code>--nav_cam_num_exclude_boundary_pixels</code> can be used to restrict the nav cam view to a central region of given dimensions when such such optimization takes place (whether the new model type is fit on the fly or read from disk when already determined). If a satisfactory solution is found and it is desired to later use the geometry mapper with such a model, note its option <code>--undistorted_crop_wins</code>, and one should keep in mind that that the restricted region specified earlier may not exactly be the region to be used with the geometry mapper, since the former is specified in distorted pixels and this one in undistorted pixels.</p>
<p>All this logic was tested and was shown to work in a satisfactory way, but no thorough attempt was made at validating that a radtan distortion model, while having more degrees of freedom, would out-perform the fisheye model. That is rather unlikely, since given sufficiently many images with good overlap, the effect of the peripheral region where the fisheye lens distortion may not perform perfectly may be small.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md92"></a>
Orthoprojecting images</h2>
<p>Given a camera image, its pose, and a mesh, a useful operation is to create a textured mesh with this camera. While the geometry mapper can create textured meshes as well, this tool does so from individual images rather than fusing them. It uses the logic from the streaming mapper instead of texrecon which is used by the geometry mapper.</p>
<p>A geometry mapper run directory has all the inputs this tool needs. It can be run as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">export ASTROBEE_SOURCE_PATH=$HOME/projects/astrobee/src
